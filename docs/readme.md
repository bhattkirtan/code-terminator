## 💡 Full Frontend Product Prompt (Multi-Framework, User-Centric)

> _“I want to upload a screenshot of my legacy UI and generate a working frontend using my selected framework (e.g., React, Angular, Vue, etc.). I’ll upload a custom SCSS file for theming. Show me a live preview, editable code (HTML/TS/CSS), and build/test results.  
Let me choose which features to include — layout, logic, theme, mock APIs, CI/CD, docs, accessibility, etc. I want to inspect the prompt used for each step, rerun parts of the pipeline, and view carbon impact.  
Once all quality checks pass, allow me to export the project as a ZIP, GitHub repo, or deployable bundle with documentation and test coverage.”_
